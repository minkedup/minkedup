# Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mickey, and I'm a 5th year Software Engineer @ RIT.

I'm currently taking Humanitarian FOSS Development (IGME-582). I'm exited to
start making meaningful contributions!

I have a strong passion for programming and love creating new things.

I strongly believe that all engineers operate within a space of intersectional
knowledge: the more we learn about everything the better engineers we become.
